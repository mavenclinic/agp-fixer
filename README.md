## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.


## Usage

Agp Fixer should be added as a settings plugin to your Gradle settings script

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
rootProject.name = "my-awesome-app"
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // actual repo here
    }
}

plugins {
    id("com.mavenclinic.agp.fixer")
}

include(":modules-go-here")
```

If you're already using the pluginManagement block, all you need to do is add the plugin!
